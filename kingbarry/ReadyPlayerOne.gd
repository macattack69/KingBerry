extends KinematicBody
#so this is at the start of all the scripts to show their parent class
#specifying this class provides customizable functionality
#KinematicBody comes barebones from Godot. It only is significant
#because it can listen for input, unlike other bodies, which listen
#to the physics engine for their physics. We have to define the physics for it here,
#and use the input to utilize said physics.

#this is the big one, like the last function takes mouse input (only movement for now)
#this function takes keyboard input (or gamepad input idk yet)
#this is pretty cool, basically its taking a direction variable,
#its checking to see if the button is pressed
#then its taking that variable, adding a positive or negative value
#it then makes sure that the direction is normalized (more on that later)
#it then uses a combination of the speed variable from earlier, and the built-in
#move_and_slide() function to manipulate the parent nodes movement
#pretttty neaaat right?

#interesting note now that I made the movement function above work
#basically, the "move_..." strings are input mapping actions dictated by
#keys, in that same mentioned input mapping menu under project settings
#thanks debugga! I do not use the hard R
